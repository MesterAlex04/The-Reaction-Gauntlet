# The-Reaction-Gauntlet
This is a reaction based game. The player has to move the joystick in the direction of the led that lights up. 
The project was made in Arduino, using different components such as: 4 different color leds, 1 passive buzzer, 1 joystick module, 1 Arduino UNO R3, 4 resistors, jumpwires.
The code was written using Arduino IDE, in C++.
I made this project because of my passion of embedded and games.
